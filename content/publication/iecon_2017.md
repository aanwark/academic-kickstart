**Abstract**

In this paper, problem of identifying and tracking the power port of remote radio unit (RRU) is addressed. The testing of RRU requires the inspection robot to insert the probes into its power and network ports. In order to solve this problem, an experimental setup of visual servoing with 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) manipulator has been established. The initial problem of recognizing and tracking the power port of RRU has been resolved using template matching and camshift tracking algorithms. Furthermore, camshift tracking algorithm has been improved to work more accurately in this application. Modified algorithm addresses the problem of swapping of major and minor axes of camshift and enhances its application to 6 DoF from 4 DoF. Experimental results have been presented to support the research claims, and computational comparison of modified tracking algorithm with camshift has been shown.
