**Abstract**

This paper presents a novel design of a wireless power transmission system which transfers an appreciable amount of electrical power wirelessly using low resonant frequency, with an excellent efficiency, and has a very low cost implementation. The designs of induction coils at both source and receiver sides are also presented in this paper. The mechanism for power transmission is through electro-magnetic induction. Also an immense knowledge of electronics was applied in order to design the source and receiver between which this transfer took place. In order to realize this method an AC-AC converter, and AC-DC rectifier were used at source and receiver sides respectively along with the resonant circuits. The work was carried out by the experimental setup and results demonstrate that proposed system design can successfully transfer the amount of power that can be used in many practical applications.
